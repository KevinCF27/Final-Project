      It is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Hajime Isayama. It is set in a world where humanity lives inside cities surrounded by enormous walls that protect them from gigantic man-eating humanoids referred to as Titans;
      The story follows Eren Yeager, who vows to exterminate the Titans after a Titan brings about the destruction of his hometown and the death of his mother
    </p>

    <p>
      The plot of Attack on Titan centers on a civilization inside three walls, the last location where humans still live. Over one hundred years ago,
      humanity was driven to the brink of extinction after the emergence of humanoid giants called Titans, who attack and eat humans on sight.
      The last remnants of humanity retreated behind three concentric walls and enjoyed nearly a century of peace. To combat Titans,
      the nation's military employs Omni-Directional Mobility Gear, a set of waist-mounted grappling hooks and gas-powered propulsion enabling immense mobility in three dimensions.

      It is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Gege Akutami, serialized in Shueisha's Weekly Shōnen Jump since March 2018. The individual chapters are collected and published by Shueisha, with fourteen tankōbon volumes released as of January 2021.
      The story of Jujutsu Kaisen follows high school student Yuji Itadori as he joins a secret organization of sorcerers in order to kill a powerful Curse named Ryomen Sukuna, of whom Yuji becomes the host.
    </p>

    <p>
      In Jujutsu Kaisen, all living beings emanate an energy called Cursed Energy (Juryoku), which arises from negative emotions that naturally flow throughout the body.
      Normal people cannot control this flow in their bodies. As a result, they continually lose Cursed Energy, resulting in the birth of Curses (Noroi).
      Jujutsu Sorcerers ("Cursed Technique Masters" or "Shamans") are people who control the flow of Cursed Energy in their bodies, allowing them to use it as they please and also to reduce its release.
      High-ranking Sorcerers and Curses can refine this energy and use it to perform Cursed Techniques (Jujutsushiki), which tend to be unique to the user or their family.

      Sora and Shiro are two hikikomori step-siblings who are known in the online gaming world as Blank, an undefeated group of gamers.
      One day, they are challenged to a game of chess by Tet, a god from another reality. The two are victorious and are offered to live in a world that centers around games.
      They accept, believing it to be a joke, and are summoned to a reality known as Disboard.
      There, a spell known as the Ten Pledges prevents the citizens of Disboard from inflicting harm on one another, forcing them to resolve their differences by gambling with games whose rules and rewards are magically enforced...
